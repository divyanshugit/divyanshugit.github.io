Hi, I'm a ML Research Engineer(Founding Engineer) at [Enkrypt AI](https://enkryptai.com).

Previously, I was working as a Research Associate at
<a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a>, under the Guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home">Prof. Prathosh A P</a>, concentrating on Neural Machine Translation for Indic Languages and Machine Unlearning in the context of Generative Models.  

<p>
I enjoy doing research and contributing to open-source projects in the context of machine learning.
My research interest started back in March 2020 when I started my first in-office internship at <a href="https://helppr.ai/">Helppr</a>,
where I worked on summarization.

</p>
<p>
In my free time, I contribute to various Open-Source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://github.com/onnx/onnx">Onnx</a>,
<a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</a>, among others.
