    - title: ML Research Engineer
      institution: Enkrypt AI
      year: 2023 - Present
      description:
        - Building a LLMOps platform that provides access control, monitoring, evaluation and guardrails for LLMs.
        - Developed a comprehensive risk identification framework utilizing Red Teaming methodologies and implemented mitigation strategies through the establishment of guardrails within LLMs.
        - Built a framework for Differentially Privacy enabled finetuning of LLMs utilizing Opacus and HuggingFace libraries. The framework enables training method like- Parameter Efficient Trainings(PEFT) as well as SFT with DP Gaurantees.
        - Developed a propierty framework named SecureLLM that leverages Homomorphic Encryption to encrypt pretrained LLMs.
    - title: Research Associate
      institution: Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, India
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Discovered a unique approach to unlearning targeted features/classes of GAN models via perturbations in the latent space.
        - Interpreted a novel method to improve generative model robustness with differential privacy. Conducted experiments with MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA datasets, evaluating accuracy (FID) and privacy preservation.
        - Developed a knowledge-distilled version of mBART for Hindi to Kannada using Hindi to Sanskrit and Sanskrit to Kannada.
        - Added an embedding layer to IndicBART's encoder to accommodate parts of speech (POS) and implemented a POS model to generate embeddings for compatibility with the input embedding.
    - title: Intern
      institution: AIcrowd
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Developed baselines for NLP and Computer Vision puzzles using deep learning models such as LSTM, BERT, and ALBERT. Utilized libraries like OpenCV (CV2), YOLO, and Detectron for Computer Vision.
        - Constructed challenging puzzles focusing on ML tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and sentiment analysis, using GANs and transformers to help students and professionals.
